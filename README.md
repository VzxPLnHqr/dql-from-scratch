## dql-from-scratch
Deep Q-Learning from scratch, in scala. Because sometimes we have to implement things ourselves
to better understand them.

### Development

1. Requires flake-enabled [Nix](https://nixos.org)
2. `git clone <this repo> && cd <this repo>`
3. `nix develop`
4. `scala-cli compile .` or `scala cli run <some file>`
